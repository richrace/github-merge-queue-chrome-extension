I respect and value your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how I handle and protect your personal information in
relation to your use of my Google Chrome extension.

## Information Collection

My Google Chrome Extensions do not collect any personal information from users. I do not gather, store, or transmit any
data that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name, email address, or location. Since no data is
collected, none of your data is sold to third parties.

how that website processes personal information. I'd like you to please review the Privacy Policy of every website you
visit.

periodically for any changes.

By using my Google Chrome Extensions, you signify your consent and agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you
I disagree with this Privacy Policy, so please refrain from using my Google Chrome Extensions.
